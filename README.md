# Network-vizualization

*This repository contains my graphic visualization project that I've submitted as my final project for Data visualization course by University of Illinois. Feel free to use this visualization. It would be helpful if you provide credits to me* :)

#### I define data vizualisation as the art of representing boring numbers and data in an interesting way. 
I gathered the required dataset from Kaggle. The data I chose to visualize represents the most common tags used in Stackoverflow's Developer Stories. 

Developer story was launched on Stackoverflow in the year 2016. For those who do not know what Stack Overflow, it is a place where developers come to build and share knowledge, and as a result, build reputation for those contributions. It's also a place where you can help write Documentation, join a Team that you contribute to, or even look for a job. Now, with the new developer story, we're making it about who you are and what you do, and that's available to everyone regardless of how you use the site. Stackoverflow can sometimes be a life saver because of the incredible amount of 
solutions it has.

####So what's up with Developer story?   
It gives you a way to showcase your skills, and maybe one day find a job.</li>
It replaces the existing, traditionally-structured CV with something that you can use even if you aren’t currently looking for a job.</li>
It does a better job of showing what matters to developers and employers than traditional CVs by focusing on what you’ve done and not just where you’ve worked or studied.

####About the visualization:

Enough with the background information Now that you know what's Stackoverflow and Developer stories, let me get back to my visualization. My visualization represents the most commonly used tags in developer story profile. I grouped the tags which are mentioned together in the developer stories and color coded them to stand out from each other. This visualization is taken from random profiles on Stackoverflow. Please keep in mind that more than 500 profiles are taken and filtered out. 500 may not be a huge number but it still makes a point.
